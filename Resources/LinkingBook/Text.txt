we are all children of the tree
like its leaves, we are beautiful
like its roots, we are strong
now link, mystnerd!

Dreams are as portals.
Flat visions of misty places.
Fragments bound below my surface.
But I can write dreams.
They flow from me...
inscribed yet now unbound.
I touch them.
And they are UNreal...
